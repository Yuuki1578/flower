flower - static site generator

Flower is a static site generator written in C. The program converts markdown files into HTML.

Flower is my personal project for learning C programming. I usually practice on platforms like tlx.toki.id, Codewars, and Codeabbey to learn the basics, but recently, I've felt bored and stuck without knowing why.

I shared my frustration with the "C and Assembly Developers" community on Twitter (or X), and someone replied, "Think of something cool to build and just build it. Stop doing Hackerrank or Leetcode stuff. Actually building something will give you 10x more experience than reversing a linked list."

And that’s how Flower was born.

Although I still ask ChatGPT for guidance and do google search, I don’t ask for complete solutions. Instead, I ask, "Is my code correct? If not, give me hints or a to-do list. Don’t give me the full solution because I want to learn programming."

Sometimes, I still doubt whether this project truly feels like my own since I use ChatGPT for help, unlike others who seem to manage without it. However, people say: "Programmers with AI will replace programmers without AI."
